# 🌬️ Wind Animation Guide - Windy-Style Overlays

**Status:** Both options fully implemented! ✅

---

## 🎨 Two Visualization Options

### Option 1: Windy.com Embed (iframe)
**Pros:**
- ✅ Professional, polished UI
- ✅ Multiple data layers (wind, waves, temp, etc.)
- ✅ Real ECMWF model data
- ✅ Time slider for forecast
- ✅ No additional coding needed

**Cons:**
- ❌ Requires internet connection
- ❌ Covers entire map
- ❌ Less customizable
- ❌ External dependency

**How to use:**
1. Check **"Windy.com"** checkbox (top of Wind Models section)
2. Full Windy map appears as overlay
3. Click **"✕ Close Windy"** button to exit

---

### Option 2: Custom Particle Animation ⭐ *Recommended*
**Pros:**
- ✅ Native integration with your map
- ✅ See buoys underneath
- ✅ Beautiful particle flow
- ✅ Works with your NOAA models (HRRR, GFS, NAM)
- ✅ Fully customizable
- ✅ Can work offline (once data loaded)

**Cons:**
- ❌ Currently using sample data
- ❌ Need Phase 2 for real wind data

**How to use:**
1. Check **"HRRR"**, **"GFS"**, or **"NAM"** checkbox
2. Animated particles appear immediately
3. Particles flow with wind direction
4. Color shows wind speed

## 🎨 Particle Animation Features

### Visual Effects:
```
🟢 Green:  Light wind (<5 kts)
🔵 Blue:   Light breeze (5-10 kts)
🟡 Yellow: Moderate (10-15 kts)
🟠 Orange: Fresh (15-25 kts)
🔴 Red:    Strong (>25 kts)
```

### Technical Specs:
- **3,000 particles** flowing simultaneously
- **100-frame lifespan** with fade effect
- **Canvas-based** rendering (high performance)
- **Real-time** wind vector interpolation
- **Automatic updates** when map moves/zooms

## 🧪 Test It Now!

### Refresh your browser first!
```
Press Ctrl+R (or Cmd+R on Mac)
```

### Test Windy Embed:
1. Check **"Windy.com ✨ Animated!"**
2. Full overlay appears
3. Interact with Windy controls
4. Close with button

### Test Custom Particles:
1. Check **"HRRR (3km, hourly)"**
2. Watch particles flow!
3. Sample data shows 2 wind vectors:
   - LA area: 12 kts from West
   - Santa Barbara: 15 kts from NW
4. Zoom/pan - particles update

---

## 📍 Current Sample Data

**Wind Vector 1:**
- Location: 33.0°N, 118.0°W (LA area)
- Speed: 12 knots
- Direction: 270° (from West)
- Color: Blue

**Wind Vector 2:**
- Location: 34.0°N, 119.0°W (Santa Barbara)
- Speed: 15 knots  
- Direction: 315° (from NW)
- Color: Yellow

**Note:** Only ~2 sample points currently. Phase 2 will add grid of 20-30 points for full coverage!

---

## 🔮 Phase 2: Real Wind Data

### What's Coming:
1. **Fetch real NOAA GRIB2 data**
   - HRRR: Grid of 3km resolution
   - GFS: Grid of 25km resolution
   - NAM: Grid of 12km resolution

2. **California Coverage:**
   - 20-30 wind vectors covering coast
   - Bounds: 32.5-40.0°N, 120.5-117.0°W
   - Updates every hour (HRRR) or 6 hours (GFS/NAM)

3. **Enhanced Particles:**
   - Denser particle field
   - Better interpolation
   - Speed-based particle density
   - Configurable particle count

---

## ⚙️ Customization Options

Want to tweak the animation? Edit `frontend/src/WindParticles.js`:

```javascript
// Line 24-25: Number of particles
const numParticles = 3000;  // Increase for denser animation
const maxAge = 100;         // Particle lifespan

// Line 26: Fade effect
const fadeOpacity = 0.96;   // Higher = longer trails

// Line 29-35: Color scheme
const getWindColor = (speed) => {
  // Customize colors and speed thresholds
}

// Line 102: Movement speed
const scale = 0.8;  // Higher = faster particles
```

## 🎯 Comparison

| Feature | Windy Embed | Custom Particles |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Visual Quality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Integration | ⭐⭐ (covers map) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (overlay) |
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Customization | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Offline Use | ❌ | ✅ (after load) |
| Real Data | ✅ (ECMWF) | 🔜 (Phase 2) |
| Setup | ✅ Done | ✅ Done |

**Recommendation:** Use **custom particles** for best integration. Use **Windy embed** for quick forecasting/planning.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Particles not visible?
1. Refresh browser (Ctrl+R)
2. Check HRRR/GFS/NAM checkbox (not Windy.com)
3. Zoom to LA/Santa Barbara area (33-34°N)
4. Open DevTools → Console for errors

### Particles not moving?
- Sample data only has 2 points
- Particles need to be near wind vectors
- Phase 2 will add grid coverage

### Performance issues?
- Reduce `numParticles` in WindParticles.js
- Close other overlays
- Use simpler basemap

### Windy embed not loading?
- Check internet connection
- Try different browser
- Clear cache

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 2A: Real Wind Data
1. Fetch NOAA GRIB2 files
2. Parse U/V wind components
3. Create grid of 20-30 vectors
4. Update every hour/6 hours

### Phase 2B: Advanced Features
- Particle density based on zoom
- Multiple particle layers (different altitudes)
- Wind barbs option (standard meteorology)
- Heatmap mode (wind speed colors)
- Custom color schemes
- Export animation as GIF/video

### Phase 2C: Swell Animation
- Apply same technique to WaveWatch III
- Particles follow ocean swell
- Different color scheme (wave height)
- Directional swell animation

## 💡 Tips

1. **Try both options!** Windy for planning, custom for integration
2. **Zoom in** to see particle detail
3. **Use HRRR** for California (best resolution)
4. **Combine** with buoy markers for complete picture
5. **Wait for Phase 2** for real wind data coverage
